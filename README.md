BootCamp Module 3 Challenge
Here I have 2 different codes: 

One summarizing profits and losses for each month and outputting total months, total Profits/Losses, amd the minimum/maximim changes from month to month. The CSV file, code, and output generated by the code in a txt file are all found within the PyBank folder.

The other code is used to count total votes for 3 different candidates and determine the winner of the poll. The CSV file, code, and output generated by the code in a txt file are all found within the PyPoll folder. 

I do have to mention, however, the main limitatipon of this code. This was made under the assumption there are only 3 candidates running in this election. So the print statements starting at row 47 may need to be changed if there are more than 3 candidates in the polls for duture use
